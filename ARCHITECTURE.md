Vylix System Architecture1. The Low-Level Layer (Assembly)Located in arch/.Boot: Responsible for transitioning the CPU from Firmware (EL3/UEFI) to Kernel (EL1/Ring 0).Traps: Handling hardware exceptions and interrupts (IRQ/FIQ).Context Switch: Saving/Restoring generic registers (x0-x30 or rax-r15) during task switching.2. The Kernel Core (C++23)Located in kernel/core/. This is the heart of Vylix, optimized for speed.Scheduler: Manages thread states (Ready, Running, Blocked).PMM (Physical Memory Manager): Uses a Bitmap allocator to manage 4KB physical pages efficiently.VMM (Virtual Memory Manager): Manages Page Tables (TTBR0/CR3).IPC: Fast path message passing mechanism.3. The Security Layer (Rust)Located in kernel/security/ and drivers/.Capability Server: Written in Rust to validate access rights.Device Drivers:Network (Wi-Fi/5G)Storage (NVMe/UFS)Input (Touch/Keyboard)Why Rust? These components process untrusted data from the outside world. Rust guarantees they are memory-safe.4. Memory Layout Strategy0x0000_0000 - 0x3FFF_FFFF: MMIO (Peripherals)0x4000_0000 - 0x4800_0000: Kernel Image (Code + Data)0x4800_0000 - 0x........: Dynamic Heap (Managed by C++ PMM)
