# **🌌 Vylix OS**

**A Modern Hybrid Microkernel built with C++23 and Rust.**

Vylix OS is an experimental operating system designed to explore the synergy between C++23's performance and Rust's memory safety in a cross-platform environment (AArch64 & x86\_64).

## **✨ Key Features**

* **Hybrid Core:** Leveraging C++ for hardware abstraction and Rust for safety-critical components.  
* **Multi-Architecture:** First-class support for both Mobile (ARM64) and Desktop (x86\_64).  
* **Modern Standards:** Built using C++23 and Rust no\_std.  
* **Bare-metal:** Zero dependencies on existing operating systems.

## **🛠️ Current Development Status**

✅ **Multi-arch Bootloader** (Multiboot2 for x86, Virt for ARM)
✅ **Cross-language FFI** (C++ calling Rust)
✅ **Basic Serial I/O** (UART & I/O Ports)
🛠️ **Physical Memory Manager (PMM)** — *In Active Development* 
⏳ **Virtual Memory Manager (VMM)** — *Planned* 
⏳ **Preemptive Scheduler** — *Planned*


## **🚀 Quick Start**

cd vylix

\# Run for ARM64 (Mobile)  
make ARCH=aarch64 run

\# Run for x86\_64 (Desktop)  
make ARCH=x86\_64 run
