AbstractVylix is an experimental, universal microkernel designed to bridge the gap between mobile (ARM64) and desktop (x86_64) computing.It implements a Hybrid-Safe Architecture:The Foundation (Ring -1): Direct hardware initialization via Assembly (AArch64/x86_64).The Engine (Ring 0): A low-latency kernel core written in Modern C++23 for raw performance and manual resource management.The Shield (Ring 1/3): Critical security modules and drivers written in Rust to enforce memory safety boundaries.Current Status: Phase 0 (Architecture Planning). This repository currently hosts design documents and build system configuration. No bootable artifacts are available yet.The Tech Stack StrategyLayerLanguageResponsibilityWhy?HardwareAssemblyBootloader, Context Switching, CPU Registers.Absolute control over the silicon startup process.Kernel CoreC++23Scheduler, PMM/VMM, IPC, Dispatcher.C++ offers zero-cost abstractions for complex high-performance logic.SecurityRustNetwork Stack, USB Drivers, Capability Monitor.Rust prevents memory leaks and buffer overflows in the most vulnerable parts of an OS.Core Principles1. Zero-Latency SchedulingVylix utilizes an O(1) priority-based preemptive scheduler written in C++. It is mathematically optimized to guarantee that UI compositing threads receive CPU time within a fixed microsecond window, ensuring 120Hz+ fluidity on mobile devices.2. Verified IsolationWhile the core engine is C++, the "gates" to the outside world (drivers) are guarded by Rust. This ensures that a buggy Wi-Fi driver cannot corrupt the kernel memory.3. Universal DesignTargeting ARMv8-A (Qualcomm/MediaTek) for mobile and x86_64 for desktop. We aim to create a single cohesive ecosystem.LicensingVylix is developed in Vietnam 🇻🇳 and licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
